# video_player
A quick and dirty "video player" for browsers. Takes advantage of extensions such as Rikaichamp to provide easy hover-over translations of subtitles.

Utilizes a modified version of https://github.com/thomassturm/VideoSub hacked to include video timing offset to re-time subtitle tracks. 

Example of running:
