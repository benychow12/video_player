# video_player
A quick and dirty "video player" for browsers. Takes advantage of extensions such as Rikaichamp to provide easy hover-over translations of subtitles.

Utilizes a modified version of https://github.com/thomassturm/VideoSub hacked to include video timing offset to re-time subtitle tracks. 

Example of running:

Could probably remove all the web framework stuff honestly. Was intending to host it as a site where users could upload video and subtitle track to use the player themselves, but the overhead might be too much. It's must better suited as a local player ran through your browser. 

Feel free to modify it however you'd like.
